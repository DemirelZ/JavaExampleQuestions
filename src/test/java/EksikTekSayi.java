     * Assume that we have an array of positive integers from m to n which includes all odd

     * Write a function that finds the missing odd number in the list.
     *
     * Ex.:
     * Input :[1,3,5,7,11,13,15]
     * Output: 11
     *
     * Input:[9,7,3]
     * Output:5

     * Constraints:
     * 1<length of the input list(nums)<100
     * There is always a single missing number
     * Array is sorted either descending or ascending.
